  A flag has been hidden somewhere on a public website, and your only clue is that it can be found using a search engine. Your task is to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques and clever search queries to locate the flag. The flag will be in the format `flag{...}`.

  *Hint: Try using advanced search operators (like `site:`, `inurl:`, or `intitle:`) to narrow your results and look for hidden pages or files. All information is publicly availableâ€”no hacking required!*
